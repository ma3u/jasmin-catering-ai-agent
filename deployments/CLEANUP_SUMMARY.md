# Deployment Cleanup Summary

## What Was Cleaned

### âœ… Working Scripts Kept
```
deployments/scripts/
â”œâ”€â”€ deploy-main.sh          # Main deployment to Sweden Central
â”œâ”€â”€ deploy-ai-foundry.sh    # AI Foundry specific deployment
â”œâ”€â”€ load-env-config.sh      # Environment configuration loader
â”œâ”€â”€ monitor-logic-app.sh    # Logic App monitoring
â”œâ”€â”€ send-test-email.sh      # Test email information
â””â”€â”€ send-test-email.py      # Python email sender
```

### ðŸ“¦ Archived Files
All experimental and non-working scripts have been moved to `deployments/archive/`:
- 11 Python scripts for assistant/agent configuration
- 6 Shell scripts for experimental approaches
- 7 Logic App workflow variations
- 7 Documentation files about failed approaches

### ðŸ”§ Current Working Solution

**Logic App**: `jasmin-order-processor-sweden`
- **Location**: Sweden Central
- **Agent ID**: `asst_xaWmWbwVkjLslHiRrg9teIP0` (created via Azure AI Projects)
- **Model**: GPT-4o via Chat Completions API
- **Status**: âœ… Fully functional

**Deployment Method**:
```bash
# Standard deployment
./deployments/scripts/deploy-main.sh

# Or with AI Foundry features
./deployments/scripts/deploy-ai-foundry.sh
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **What Works**: Chat Completions API with embedded prompt
2. **What Doesn't**: Direct Assistant API access on this Azure resource
3. **Agent Created**: New agent exists but RAG upload requires manual steps
4. **Production Ready**: System is fully functional as deployed

## Next Steps

For production use:
1. Use `deploy-main.sh` for deployments
2. Monitor with `monitor-logic-app.sh`
3. Test with simulated emails (5-minute timer)
4. Upload documents via Azure AI Studio if needed

The deployment is clean, organized, and production-ready!
